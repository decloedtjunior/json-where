# json-rel

> Transparent data references in JSON

---

`json-rel` converges the following standards and libraries in order to help normalize JSON relations:

 - JsonPath
   * Specification: http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/
   * Library: https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonpath
 - JsonPointer
   * Specification: http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-appsawg-json-pointer-08
   * Library: https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonpointer
 - JsonQuery
   * Library: https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-query

This library is still under construction (particularly in order to reach full transparency), but it can technically be used until then

## Installation

`> npm install json-rel`
